## LEADER_ET_AL

This repository contains matadata necessary for alignment and analysis of the human NSCLC CITEseq dataset presented in
 Maier, B., Leader, A.M., Chen, S.T. et al. A conserved dendritic-cell regulatory program limits antitumour immunity. Nature 580, 257â€“262 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2134-y
and
Leader, et al. (in preparation as of 4/27/20)

All human sequencing data is available on NCBI with BioProject ID PRJNA609924.

Alignment was performed using Cellranger v3.1.0 using feature barcoding. Feature barcode tables for the alignment are found in /feature_barcoding_tables/ of this repository.
